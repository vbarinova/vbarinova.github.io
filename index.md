<i>I specialize in 2D digital art, but my academic coursework is heavily involved in software engineering, computer science, and game development.
For class projects, I've done a lot of UI art and design implementations in code.
<br>Current work interests and focus: Graphic design, interface design</i>

<h2><a name="h1">Graphic Design</a></h2>
<i>These are my graphic design works during my employment at UCIrvine while a student. The brochure designs are shown as 3D-generated demos I made during the production.</i><br>
<i>I have also designed the website logo for the <b><a href="https://sites.uci.edu/ucinspire/">UCInspire program</a>.</b></i>

<img src="images/demo_inspire.png"><br>
Design Notes: For this brochure, I had decided to evolve the main cover page from the program logo that I created earlier. The color scheme follows the UCIrvine brand guidelines, but the placement of colors is intended to portray a sort of playful feeling to go along with the program's summer timeframe.<br><br>
<b><a href="https://sites.uci.edu/engr32/">3+2 Engineering Program</a> brochure</b>
<img src="images/demo_32.png"><br>
Design Notes: For this brochure, I continued to follow the UCI brand standards for the color scheme, and decided to focus on a modern but professional looking theme for the overall look of the design as the program is a combination of bachelor's and master's degrees for involved students.<br><br>
<b><a href="http://int2025.eng.uci.edu/">INT2025 Conference Website</a></b><br>
<i>I have created the logo, home, and page banners for the INT2025 conference website.
  <br>Everything was made using CC0 stock images.</i>

<br>
Design Notes: For the website, I considered the main conference theme - Artificial Intelligence in 2025- and decided to go for a modern look to evoke the feeling of 'future technology' and decide on the cyan with magenta accent for the color scheme.
